# Q-CTRL Python Cirq

The aim of the Q-CTRL Cirq Adapter package is to provide export functions allowing
users to deploy established error-robust quantum control protocols from the
open literature and defined in Q-CTRL Open Controls on Google quantum devices
and simulators.

Anyone interested in quantum control is welcome to contribute to this project.
